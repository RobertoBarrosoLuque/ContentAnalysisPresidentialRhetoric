# ContentAnalysisPresidentialRhetoric

Project Pitch:

We plan to conduct an exploration of the semantic relationship between US presidential speeches and executive orders. Specifically, we are interested in how the issues a president discusses in their speeches map onto the executive actions they take. We plan to examine two corpuses: a dataset of presidential speeches (https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches) and a corpus of executive summaries from Clinton to Trump (possibly including Biden for analyses that won’t be tainted by having only a few months’ of data). We choose to consider the role of the president here and not other political actors because we believe the president has great influence over public perception of policy issues. Further, in recent decades, executive orders have become a more mainstream way for a president to assert their power. It is not uncommon for there to be back-and-forths between successive presidents of alternate parties striking, then reinstating, then striking, then reinstating a particular order. We are interested in examining these interplays, and in looking at how presidents frame and justify the actions they take to the public. A question we have is whether presidents from different parties who focus on similar policy issues might frame those issues in different ways.
