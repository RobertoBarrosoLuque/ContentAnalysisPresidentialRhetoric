Such discretion shall be exercised with due regard to the regulations and guidance prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for the civil service and, for contractual work, subject to applicable regulations and directives of the Office of Management and Budget.\\n“(b) Investigations for determining fitness for contractual or nonappropriated fund employment.

Policy. (a) Executive branch vetting policies and procedures relating to suitability, contractor or Federal employee fitness, eligibility to hold a sensitive position, authorization to be issued a Federal credential for access to federally controlled facilities and information systems, and eligibility for access to classified information shall be aligned using consistent standards to the extent possible, shall provide for reciprocal recognition, and shall ensure cost-effective, timely, and efficient protection of the national interest, while providing fair treatment to those upon whom the Federal Government relies to conduct our Nation's business and protect national security.\\n“(b) The Government's tools, systems, and processes for conducting these background investigations and managing sensitive investigative information should keep pace with technological advancements, regularly integrating current best practices to better anticipate, detect, and counter malicious activities, and threats posed by external or internal actors who may seek to do harm to the Government's personnel, property, and information. To help fulfill these responsibilities, there shall be a primary executive branch investigative service provider whose mission is to provide effective, efficient, and secure background investigations for the Federal Government.\\n“(c) Executive branch vetting policies and procedures shall be sustained by an enhanced risk-management approach that facilitates early detection of issues by an informed, aware, and responsible Federal workforce; results in quality decisions enabled by improved vetting capabilities; and advances Government-wide capabilities through enterprise approaches.\\n“(d) The appointment or retention of each covered individual shall be subject to an investigation. Federal investigative standards established pursuant to this order shall be designed to develop information as to whether the employment or retention in employment in the Federal service of the person being investigated is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security, and the scope of the investigation shall be determined in the first instance according to the degree of material adverse effect the occupant of the position sought to be filled could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, on the national security.”\\n“(e) Investigative agencies shall control the reports, information, and other investigative materials that are developed during the vetting process. Recipient departments and agencies may retain and use the received reports, information, and other investigative material within that recipient for authorized purposes (including, but not limited to, adjudications, hearings and appeals, continuous evaluation, inspector general functions, counterintelligence, research, and insider threat programs), in compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (section 552a of title 5, United States Code). Investigative agencies shall ensure that their applicable System of Records Notices include, at a minimum, the authorized uses of the recipient departments and agencies such as those set forth above. Recipient departments and agencies shall not make any external releases of received information, other than to an investigative subject for the purpose of providing procedural rights or administrative due process; and shall direct any other requests for external releases of copies of the reports, information, and other investigative materials to the investigative agency. In the event redisclosure by the recipient agency is required by compulsory legal process, the recipient agency shall consult with the investigating agency. The investigative agency shall maintain the reports, information, and other investigative material in a system of records subject to the Privacy Act and ensure that any re-disclosure does not violate statutory restrictions or result in the unauthorized disclosure of: classified information, information subject to a claim of privilege, or information that is otherwise lawfully exempt from disclosure. Subject to Security Executive Agent authorizations consistent with section 3341(e)(5) of title 50, United States Code, the investigative agencies shall make reports, information, and other investigative material available, as necessary, to carry out the responsibilities set forth in this order, including but not limited to, authorized executive branch-sponsored research and initiatives for enterprise-wide continuous performance improvement of vetting policy and procedures, as permitted by law.”\\n(c) Section 1.2 of Executive Order 13467 is revised to read as follows:\\n\\n\\n“Sec. 1.2. Applicability. (a) This order applies to vetting of all covered individuals as defined in section 1.3(h), except that:\\n“(i) the provisions regarding eligibility for physical access to federally controlled facilities and logical access to federally controlled information systems do not apply to individuals exempted in accordance with guidance pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act (title III of Public Law 107-347) and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 of August 27, 2004; and\\n“(ii) the qualification standards for enlistment, appointment, and induction into the Armed Forces pursuant to title 10, United States Code, are unaffected by this order.\\n“(b) This order also applies to vetting for employees of agencies working in or for the legislative or judicial branches when the vetting is conducted by the executive branch.”\\n(d) Section 1.3(a) of Executive Order 13467 is revised to read as follows:\\n“(a) ‘Adjudication' means the evaluation of pertinent data in a background investigation, as well as any other available information that is relevant and reliable, to determine whether a covered individual is:\\n“(i) suitable for Government employment;\\n“(ii) eligible for logical and physical access;\\n“(iii) eligible for access to classified information;\\n“(iv) eligible to hold a sensitive position; or\\n“(v) fit to perform work for or on behalf of the Government as a Federal employee, contractor, or nonappropriated fund employee.”\\n(e) Sections 1.3(c) and 1.3(d) of Executive Order 13467 are revised to read as follows:\\n“(c) ‘Classified information' means information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009, or a successor or predecessor order, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) to require protection against unauthorized disclosure.\\n“(d) ‘Continuous evaluation (CE)' means a vetting process to review the background of an individual who has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position at any time during the period of eligibility. CE leverages a set of automated record checks and business rules to assist in the on-going assessment of an individual's continued eligibility.

Except as described above and except to the extent authority to apply additional requirements is vested by statute in an agency, an agency may not establish additional investigative or adjudicative requirements (other than requirements for the conduct of a polygraph examination consistent with law, directive, or regulation) that exceed existing requirements without the approval of the Suitability and Credentialing Executive Agent exercising its Suitability Executive Agent functions or Security Executive Agent, as appropriate. Any additional requirements approved by the appropriate Executive Agent shall be limited to those that are necessary to address significant needs unique to the agency involved, to protect national security, or to satisfy a requirement imposed by law.”\\n\\n\\n“Sec. 2.3.
